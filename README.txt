The .py files in this program can be run either using a Python IDE like PyCharm, or just through the command prompt. I would, however, recommend running the .ipynb
file instead in Anaconda for ease of use, as well as for graphs. 
There is a lot of data generated in this program which isn't used, so feel free to explore anything you'd be interested in, or fix existing issues in functions I
didn't use or focus on. You can also streamline the code if you feel it runs too slowly, I didn't bother optimizing it and there are a lot of unnecessary artifacts
from testing and previous iterations.
Within the code there are also some commented-out lines which would save some outputs into a nicely formatted CSV. Comment those in if you want to use that data, or
save some of your own.
For anything else, you're welcome to reach out to me.
